The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].\n\nBelow is a high-level example of how `read4` works:\nFile file(\"abcde`\"); // File is \"`abcde`\", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'\nchar[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters\nread4(buf4); // read4 returns 4.

The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a `get` or `put` operation is called on it.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput\n[\"LFUCache\", \"put\", \"put\", \"get\", \"put\", \"get\", \"get\", \"put\", \"get\", \"get\", \"get\"]\n[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]\nExplanation\n// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x\n// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)\nLFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);\nlfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1\nlfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1\nlfu.get(1);      // return 1\n                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.\n\n                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)\nlfu.get(3);      // return 3\n                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2\nlfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.\n\n                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2\nlfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)\nlfu.get(3);      // return 3\n                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3\nlfu.get(4);      // return 4\n                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3\n\nConstraints:\n`0 <= capacity, key, value <= 104`\nAt most `105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.\n\nFollow up: Could you do both operations in `O(1)` time complexity?"

        "description": "LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.\n\nRules and restrictions:\nYou can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.\n\nThe cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.\n\nYou totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.\n\nFor each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.\n\nYou're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. \nOne of the best strategies is:\n1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. (Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) \n2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\n\n3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. \nSince there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work. So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]\nOutput: 21\nExplanation:Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21\nOne of the best strategies is:\n1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. \n2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.\n\n3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.\n\nNote:\nN and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].\n\nIn the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].\n\nIn the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].\n\nYou could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.\n\nIf you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.\n\nWe don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacation days."

A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\nThe code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n\nA valid `TAG_NAME` only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is invalid.\n\nA valid `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is invalid.\n\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n\nA `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).\n\nThe cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`. \n`CDATA_CONTENT` may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. \n\nValid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.\n\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\n\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\n\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\n\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n\n\nInvalid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\nNote:\nFor simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain `letters`, `digits`, `'<'`,`'>'`,`'/'`,`'!'`,`'['`,`']'` and `' '`."

Here are the specific rules:\nThe hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.\n\nThe returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one).

        "description": "You are given a string `expression` representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.\n\nThe syntax for these expressions is given as follows.\n\nAn expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable.  Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\nA let-expression takes the form `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)`, where `let` is always the string `\"let\"`, then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression `expr`.\n\nAn add-expression takes the form `(add e1 e2)` where `add` is always the string `\"add\"`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n\nA mult-expression takes the form `(mult e1 e2)` where `mult` is always the string `\"mult\"`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", or \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n\nFinally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.\n\n\nEvaluation Examples:\nInput: (add 1 2)\nOutput: 3\nInput: (mult 3 (add 2 3))\nOutput: 15\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x 5))\nOutput: 10\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\n\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\nInput: (let x 3 x 2 x)\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\nInput: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\n\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\nInput: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context\nof the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.\n\nInput: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) \nOutput 4\nExplanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.\n\nNote:\nThe given string `expression` is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.  The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.\n\nThe length of `expression` is at most 2000.  (It is also non-empty, as that would not be a legal expression.)\nThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer."

You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number `i` more than `rollMax[i]` (1-indexed) consecutive times. \nGiven an array of integers `rollMax` and an integer `n`, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact `n` rolls.\n\nTwo sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]\nOutput: 34\nExplanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1]\nOutput: 30\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3]\nOutput: 181\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= n <= 5000`\n`rollMax.length == 6`\n`1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15`"

It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.\n\nNotice that you can return the substrings in any order.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"adefaddaccc\"\nOutput: [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"]\nExplanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:\n[\n  \"adefaddaccc\"\n  \"adefadda\",\n  \"ef\",\n  \"e\",\n  \"f\",\n  \"ccc\",\n]\nIf we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose \"adefadda\", we are left with \"ccc\" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose \"ef\" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"abbaccd\"\nOutput: [\"d\",\"bb\",\"cc\"]\nExplanation: Notice that while the set of substrings [\"d\",\"abba\",\"cc\"] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= s.length <= 10^5`\n`s` contains only lowercase English letters."

If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.\n\nThe ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.\n\nThe ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.\n\nReturn the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: \n- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.\n\nSo the total number of trips is 4.\n\nNote that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: \n- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\nSo the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:\n- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.\n\nSo the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: boxes = [[2,4],[2,5],[3,1],[3,2],[3,7],[3,1],[4,4],[1,3],[5,2]], portsCount = 5, maxBoxes = 5, maxWeight = 7\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:\n- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the second box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.\n\n- The ship takes the sixth and seventh boxes, goes to port 3, then port 4, then storage. 3 trips. \n- The ship takes the eighth and ninth boxes, goes to port 1, then port 5, then storage. 3 trips.\n\nSo the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14.\n\n\nConstraints:\n`1 <= boxes.length <= 105`\n`1 <= portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight <= 105`\n`1 <= ports\u200b\u200bi <= portsCount`\n`1 <= weightsi <= maxWeight`"

Otherwise, copy the last `m` elements of the stream to a separate container.\n\nRemove the smallest `k` elements and the largest `k` elements from the container.\n\nCalculate the average value for the rest of the elements rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\nImplement the `MKAverage` class:\n`MKAverage(int m, int k)` Initializes the MKAverage object with an empty stream and the two integers `m` and `k`.\n\n`void addElement(int num)` Inserts a new element `num` into the stream.\n\n`int calculateMKAverage()` Calculates and returns the MKAverage for the current stream rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput\n[\"MKAverage\", \"addElement\", \"addElement\", \"calculateMKAverage\", \"addElement\", \"calculateMKAverage\", \"addElement\", \"addElement\", \"addElement\", \"calculateMKAverage\"]\n[[3, 1], [3], [1], [], [10], [], [5], [5], [5], []]\nOutput\n[null, null, null, -1, null, 3, null, null, null, 5]\nExplanation\nMKAverage obj = new MKAverage(3, 1); \nobj.addElement(3);        // current elements are [3]\nobj.addElement(1);        // current elements are [3,1]\nobj.calculateMKAverage(); // return -1, because m = 3 and only 2 elements exist.\n\nobj.addElement(10);       // current elements are [3,1,10]\nobj.calculateMKAverage(); // The last 3 elements are [3,1,10].\n\n                          // After removing smallest and largest 1 element the container will be `[3].\n\n                          // The average of [3] equals 3/1 = 3, return 3\nobj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5]\nobj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5,5]\nobj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5,5,5]\nobj.calculateMKAverage(); // The last 3 elements are [5,5,5].\n\n                          // After removing smallest and largest 1 element the container will be `[5].\n\n                          // The average of [5] equals 5/1 = 5, return 5\n``\n\nConstraints:\n`3 <= m <= 105`\n`1 <= k*2 < m`\n`1 <= num <= 105`\nAt most `105` calls will be made to `addElement` and `calculateMKAverage`."
